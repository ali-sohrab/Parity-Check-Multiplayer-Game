Eliminate Waste (Harsh Mehta)

During this week we met on Tuesday, 11/8 and decided to come up with the final idea and changes for the game.
We coded almost every screen on the client side, that interacts with client.
Proper method calls and return types were discussed so that no time and resources are wasted at the time of integration.

Moreover, a number of drawbacks and issues were faced while coding in Processing tool. Moreover, a lot of code redundancies and efforts 
were estimated in developing game in processing so we decided to use Greenfoot as our IDE. This saved us all the time we would have 
invested in coding and itegrating code in procesing.

During the meeting we decided to strictly follow Object Oriented Concepts and design patterns to keep the code modular and easy to debug 
and hence simplifying the task of error solving and debugging.

We also have decided to carry out the video tutorial for teaching non-CS students on campus during this meeting.
