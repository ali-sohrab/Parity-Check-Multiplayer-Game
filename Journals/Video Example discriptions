After watching and understanding the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-35-sPTYPJg 
As per the video
There was an activity to imitate the computerâ€™s working how it detects the error via using simple methods like Parity. 
In this activity they were able to detect the card which was flipped out of dozens of cards (white and black), using the parity method that computers use to find out if an error occurred in the data stored.
This is one of the very interesting, easy yet complex ways to demonstrate the same and describing the methods computers adapt to detect errors in real world.
