Eliminate Waste (Harsh Mehta):
	
	Eliminate waste is the main motive to adopt a software development methodology during the process of software development. Eliminate waste ultimately results in better productivity and performance. Indirectly this also takes care of the optimum resource utilization.

	The main reason to go with “Eliminate Waste” as my key area during the entire process of Software Development with Code Titans is to make the optimum of this opportunity to help high school students with computer related fundamentals. Also as a part of my responsibility, I will take utmost care that we make most of the time we meet and eliminate waste of time. Team meetings will be organised on time that is convenient to everybody so that no time is wasted in waiting for any team member. 
	
	I will also see that the discussions we carry out during the development cycle is productive and fruitful. My motto will not be just to eliminate the waste of time during the development cycle, but also to develop a product that runs efficiently without acquiring unwanted hardware resources.

	During the entire development cycle I will make sure that all the resources invested are utilised full-fledgedly.
