Quoting from www.exteremeprogramming.org ; “Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face daily. We will work together on everything from requirements to code. We will create the best solution to our problem that we can together.” I will always try my level best to have effective communication among team members as well as outside the team.
	To achieve the above goal, I came up with the group on Google Hangouts to have daily discussion and daily updates from each team member for transparency. Along with that, we should have one/two (based on need) weekly meetings to discuss common issues or solutions we need to come up with the simple and best solution for the problems/tasks. 
	Communication not only includes communication within the team members but also includes how we present our project or how we communicate to another person regarding our project. In order to improve communication of each team member; we will go to 5  complete strangers in college and will play a game with them which will in turn fetch us extra credits as a bonus along with improved communication. Also, I will try to keep our presentations sharp and crispy to professor as well as audience.
As I have taken communication as a core value, I will ensure that there are no communication gaps among the team members and no conflicts should occur due the same. I will always strive of the transparent team communication among us to have the great project journey ahead.
