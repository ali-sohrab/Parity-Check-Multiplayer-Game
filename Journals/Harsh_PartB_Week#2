Eliminate Waste (Harsh Mehta)

Many times it is difficult to spot or to solve the waste during the development. It is sometime difficult to find what part of development is
waste and what is not. I take the utmost care to eliminate the waste during the development process. We as a team Code Titans have always 
kept ourselves distant from ambiguity in requirements.

Before we begin to code any part of the module, we closely analyse every smallest aspect to prevent the resultant over-production. We also 
make over goals clear at the begining of the sprint. This prevents ambiguity caused due to unclear requirements or constantly changing
requirements. With each sprint, we keep adding new features to the product without any kind of repetition or redundancy.
