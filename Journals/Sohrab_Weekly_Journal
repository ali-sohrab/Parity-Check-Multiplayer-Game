XP Core Value : Respect
Date          : 9/18/2016

I took Respect as a core value as I think we all come from different ethnic backgrounds, regions, cities and all of us need respect whosoever we are, no matter what gender we have. I have learnt this from my childhood, that “if you want to earn respect you need to give respect”. I will follow the same learning in my team.
            Our team The Code Titans, we give respect to all the team members whether it is in terms of suggestions, availability, feedbacks, decisions etc. We decided that it will always be team decisions not an individual decision. Also, we will be keen to maintain a positive attitude within our team so that everyone will feel comfortable and have a good environment to work in.
            Extreme Programming (http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html) defines 'Respect' as, “Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member. Everyone contributes value even if it's simply enthusiasm. Developers respect the expertise of the customers and vice versa. Management respects our right to accept responsibility and receive authority over our own work.”
            We decided to make project on Error Detection and will maintain Respect as XP core value till the completion of project.
