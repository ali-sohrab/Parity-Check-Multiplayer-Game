Eliminate Waste

After week#2 we conducted meetings on daily basis to bring in improvements in our project. After the discussion and exchange of idea we
finally decided appearance, and presentation of game. We code titans are going to use tool ‘processing 3’ to design our game.
The main benefit of using processing 3 is its vast library that will save our time in devising the logic and hence increasing efficiency.

We are in process to finalise the work distribution in such a way dependency is minimum so that waste of time and resources is eliminated.
In order to eliminate the time waste and code redundancy, we have also decided to use github(a version control tool) so that each one of 
us works on the updated copy of code. At the end we can merge the code.
