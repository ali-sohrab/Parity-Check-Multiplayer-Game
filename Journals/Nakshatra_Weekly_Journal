XP Core Value : Feedback

Extreme Programming Explained: “Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming; feedback is the treatment”. Which is perfectly true to any programming environment whether it is software development, website designing or a simple application. Feedback is the most important part of any development process thus I being adapting “feedback” as my center of attention (of all the Xp core values) will make sure that we are taking feedbacks from our peers and teammates regularly and thus processing them and implementing that in our project throughout its development life.
For instance, while deciding the topic of the project I asked everyone to share their views and feedbacks for the topic as well as some videos that we were watching, and after effective discussion we decided the topic “Error Detection” with a consensus of opinion among all.
My main KRA’s (Key Responsibility Areas) would be:
1. Taking individual feedbacks from all teammates and making a healthy environment among us by sharing it with others and helping all in personal growth and project growth as well.
2. Scheduling feedbacks sessions twice a week across team and if required individually too.
3. Will be sharing the MOM (Minutes of Meeting) via email and also update it on shared spaces for other to refer if they want to.
Along with the above specific points my main focus will remain on the Project growth and converting it to a successful product along with individual growth.
