Eliminate Waste

A common agile development practice is the ‘retrospective’, which is the process of the team meeting after each short iteration 
to discuss what went well, what didn’t, and what could be done differently in the next iteration.

This iterative process of learning and continual improvement is an important part of identifying waste and eliminating it.
In my experience this is one of the key benefits of agile software development. After successfully completing the part-A of project we 
are set to start with part-B. Eliminate waste and fully utilize available resources during each sprint will remain my primary focus.

I will take utmost care that we don't invest resources in unnecessary development and functionalities throughout the Part-B of development.
