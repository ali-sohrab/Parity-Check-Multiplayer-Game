	In the team meeting held this week, we finally decided the architecture and process flow of the entire project. 
Keeping in mind the goal of minimising the waste of time and resources we further revised all the UML diagrams and architecture of the 
project. I revised the sequence diagram to eliminate all the unnecessary function calls and object creation.
There were certain modifications required in class diagram were also done and updated on github repository.

	To eliminate the waste of time of players who play the game, we decided to give hint if they are stuck 
somewhere in the game. This decision have further brought revisions in all the UML diagrams. 
Since now we are ready with all the drafting and designing of the game flow, we are set to start development in the next week. 
Aaron has already designed an abstract code which will be finalised after proper review and discussion in the coming week.
